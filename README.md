## What I want to do is make Schrodinger's equation animation.
Just to do : 
1. deduce the Schrodinger equation from the Hamiltonian and the wave function equation of one-dimensional electron in infinite deep potential well.
2. learn how to use manim library to create animations.
3. create the animation.
